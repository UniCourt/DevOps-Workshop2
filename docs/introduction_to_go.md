## Go

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.

## Why Golang?

Go is a relatively young open-source programming language. Google designed it to meet the needs of developers working on large-scale projects. Although it incorporates concepts from other languages like C, Go has unique features in terms of application development capabilities.

Go is very powerful when it comes to concurrency. It is easier to create applications that effectively utilize modern multi-core and networked machines while keeping neat and modular programming code.
