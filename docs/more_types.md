### Pointers

Go has pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a value.

The type *T is a pointer to a T value. Its zero value is nil.

var p *int
The & operator generates a pointer to its operand.

i := 42
p = &i
The * operator denotes the pointer's underlying value.

fmt.Println(*p) // read i through the pointer p
*p = 21         // set i through the pointer p
This is known as "dereferencing" or "indirecting".

Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	i, j := 42, 2701

	p := &i         // point to i
	fmt.Println(*p) // read i through the pointer
	*p = 21         // set i through the pointer
	fmt.Println(i)  // see the new value of i

	p = &j         // point to j
	*p = *p / 37   // divide j through the pointer
	fmt.Println(j) // see the new value of j
}
```
### Structs

A struct is a collection of fields.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Vertex{1, 2})
}
```

### Struct Fields

Struct fields are accessed using a dot.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{1, 2}
	v.X = 4
	fmt.Println(v.X)
}
```
### Pointers to structs

Struct fields can be accessed through a struct pointer.

To access the field X of a struct when we have the struct pointer p we could write (*p).X. However, that notation is cumbersome, so the language permits us instead to write just p.X, without the explicit dereference.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{1, 2}
	p := &v
	p.X = 1e9
	fmt.Println(v)
}
```

### Struct Literals
A struct literal denotes a newly allocated struct value by listing the values of its fields.

You can list just a subset of fields by using the Name: syntax. (And the order of named fields is irrelevant.)

The special prefix & returns a pointer to the struct value.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y int
}

var (
	v1 = Vertex{1, 2}  // has type Vertex
	v2 = Vertex{X: 1}  // Y:0 is implicit
	v3 = Vertex{}      // X:0 and Y:0
	p  = &Vertex{1, 2} // has type *Vertex
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(v1, p, v2, v3)
}
```

### Arrays

The type [n]T is an array of n values of type T.

The expression

var a [10]int
declares a variable a as an array of ten integers.

An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized. This seems limiting, but don't worry; Go provides a convenient way of working with arrays.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a [2]string
	a[0] = "Hello"
	a[1] = "World"
	fmt.Println(a[0], a[1])
	fmt.Println(a)

	primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
	fmt.Println(primes)
}
```
### Slices
An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.

The type []T is a slice with elements of type T.

A slice is formed by specifying two indices, a low and high bound, separated by a colon:
```
a[low : high]
```
This selects a half-open range which includes the first element, but excludes the last one.

The following expression creates a slice which includes elements 1 through 3 of a:

```
a[1:4]
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}

	var s []int = primes[1:4]
	fmt.Println(s)
}
```
### Slices are like references to arrays

A slice does not store any data, it just describes a section of an underlying array.

Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array.

Other slices that share the same underlying array will see those changes.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	names := [4]string{
		"John",
		"Paul",
		"George",
		"Ringo",
	}
	fmt.Println(names)

	a := names[0:2]
	b := names[1:3]
	fmt.Println(a, b)

	b[0] = "XXX"
	fmt.Println(a, b)
	fmt.Println(names)
}
```
### Slice length and capacity

A slice has both a length and a capacity.

The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains.

The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice.

The length and capacity of a slice s can be obtained using the expressions len(s) and cap(s).

You can extend a slice's length by re-slicing it, provided it has sufficient capacity. Try changing one of the slice operations in the example program to extend it beyond its capacity and see what happens.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
	printSlice(s)

	// Slice the slice to give it zero length.
	s = s[:0]
	printSlice(s)

	// Extend its length.
	s = s[:4]
	printSlice(s)

	// Drop its first two values.
	s = s[2:]
	printSlice(s)
}

func printSlice(s []int) {
	fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s)
}
```
### Appending to a slice
It is common to append new elements to a slice, and so Go provides a built-in append function. The documentation of the built-in package describes append.

func append(s []T, vs ...T) []T
The first parameter s of append is a slice of type T, and the rest are T values to append to the slice.

The resulting value of append is a slice containing all the elements of the original slice plus the provided values.

If the backing array of s is too small to fit all the given values a bigger array will be allocated. The returned slice will point to the newly allocated array.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var s []int
	printSlice(s)

	// append works on nil slices.
	s = append(s, 0)
	printSlice(s)

	// The slice grows as needed.
	s = append(s, 1)
	printSlice(s)

	// We can add more than one element at a time.
	s = append(s, 2, 3, 4)
	printSlice(s)
}

func printSlice(s []int) {
	fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s)
}
```
### Maps
A map maps keys to values.

The zero value of a map is nil. A nil map has no keys, nor can keys be added.

The make function returns a map of the given type, initialized and ready for use.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Vertex struct {
	Lat, Long float64
}

var m map[string]Vertex

func main() {
	m = make(map[string]Vertex)
	m["Bell Labs"] = Vertex{
		40.68433, -74.39967,
	}
	fmt.Println(m["Bell Labs"])
}
```

### Mutating Maps
Insert or update an element in map m:

```
m[key] = elem
```
Retrieve an element:
```
elem = m[key]
```
Delete an element:
```
delete(m, key)
```
Test that a key is present with a two-value assignment:
```
elem, ok = m[key]
```
If key is in m, ok is true. If not, ok is false.

If key is not in the map, then elem is the zero value for the map's element type.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	m := make(map[string]int)

	m["Answer"] = 42
	fmt.Println("The value:", m["Answer"])

	m["Answer"] = 48
	fmt.Println("The value:", m["Answer"])

	delete(m, "Answer")
	fmt.Println("The value:", m["Answer"])

	v, ok := m["Answer"]
	fmt.Println("The value:", v, "Present?", ok)
}
```

### Exercise: Maps
Implement WordCount. It should return a map of the counts of each “word” in the string s.
