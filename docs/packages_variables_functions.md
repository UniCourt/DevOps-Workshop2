### Packages

Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in package main.

This program is using the packages with import paths "fmt" and "math/rand".

By convention, the package name is the same as the last element of the import path. For instance, the "math/rand" package comprises files that begin with the statement package rand.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}

```

### Imports

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Now you have %g problems.\n", math.Sqrt(7))
}

```

### Exported names

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, Pizza is an exported name, as is Pi, which is exported from the math package.

pizza and pi do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

Run the code. Notice the error message.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(math.pi)
}
```

### Functions

A function can take zero or more arguments.

In this example, add takes two parameters of type int.

Notice that the type comes after the variable name.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

### Multiple results

A function can return any number of results.

The swap function returns two strings.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
	return y, x
}

func main() {
	a, b := swap("hello", "world")
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

### Variables

The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.

A var statement can be at package or function level. We see both in this example.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var c, python, java bool

func main() {
	var i int
	fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
}
```

### Variables with initializers

A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.

If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var i, j int = 1, 2

func main() {
	var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
	fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
}
```

### Short variable declarations

Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i, j int = 1, 2
	k := 3
	c, python, java := true, false, "no!"

	fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}
```
